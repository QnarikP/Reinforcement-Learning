# Reinforcement Learning Projects

This repository contains various Reinforcement Learning (RL) projects covering different topics and approaches in the field. Each project includes implementations, experiments, and insights related to RL algorithms and their applications.

## Installation

To set up the environment, ensure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Dependencies may vary across projects, so check each project's README for specific setup instructions.

# Acknowledgements

The experiments and code in this repository were largely inspired by the ["book"](http://incompleteideas.net/) â€“ my trusty guide through the labyrinth of Reinforcement Learning. Special thanks to my lecturer, ["Mr. H.S. Abgaryan"](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hovhannes-abgaryan/) (a.k.a. Mr. Anthony Stark), whose lectures were as enlightening as they were entertaining (and who somehow made debugging seem almost fun).
